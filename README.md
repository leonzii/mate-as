# Introduccion

The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in mathematics** using online materials.
It's for those who want a proper grounding in concepts fundamental to all math disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

## Bases

### Pruebas
Most people's views of mathematics are destroyed in school by focusing on memorization and regurgitation. But mathematicians see math as an elegant way to explain the world around us. This class covers how to think like a mathematician and solve problems. 

**Topics covered:**
`Mathematical mindset`
`Number Theory`

Courses || Prerequisites
:-- | :--:
[Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking)  | none

### Discrete Mathematics
Discrete mathematics is the mathematics of objects and ideas. It includes topics such as combinatorics, graph theory, and logic. The topics discussed here also form the basis of the field of computer science. For mathematics majors, a discrete math course is usually also a first introduction to formal proofs. 

**Topics covered:**
`Counting`
`Grouping`
`Classifying`
`Logic and Reasoning`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
[Mathematics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) | 14 weeks | 6-8 hours/week | Calculus 1C

### Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is the mathematics of spatial relationships that deals with the manipulation of vectors and matrices. It provides an elegant way to consider many simultaneous equations, visualize arbitrarily-many dimensions, and explain complex phenomena in simple terms.

**Topics covered:**
`Vector and matrix calculations`
`Linear transformations`
`Vector spaces`
`Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites

[Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) | 14 weeks | 12 hours/week | Essence of Linear Algebra

### Probability & Statistics
Probability is the mathematics of uncertainty. Statistics is the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty in real-world data. These two related but distinct fields of study help us describe variation and uncertainty in the world around us. These courses make heavy use of discrete mathematics, linear algebra, and calculus, and serve as a first opportunity to apply what you've learned in the other core courses.

**Topics covered:**
`Random variables`
`Expectation and Variance`
`Probability Distributions`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites

[Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/) | 14 weeks | 12-16 hours/week | Multivariable Calculus, Math for Computer Science, Linear Algebra
[Statistics for Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/) | 14 weeks | 12-16 hours/week | Probability

### Introduction to Analysis
Analysis is the mathematics of sequences and limits. Intro to Analysis is a course that builds on the concepts of Calculus and provides a rigorous and formalized study of the foundations of Calculus. This course will use formal proofs to establish mathematical results, starting by proving the existence of real numbers and building the foundation of single-variable Calculus from scratch.

**Topics covered:**
`Proofs`
`Real analysis`

[Introduction to Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-100a-real-analysis-fall-2020/) | 14 weeks | 8-10 hours/week | Multivariable Calculus
[Supplemental Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaKLXK4hFFQ&list=PLmU0FIlJY-MngWPhBDUPelVV3GhDw_mJu&index=1) | 16 weeks | 8-10 hours/week | Multivariable Calculus

### Introduction to Abstract Algebra
Abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. Abstract algebra was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from older parts of algebra, more specifically from elementary algebra, using variables to represent numbers in computation and reasoning.

**Topics covered:**
`Group Theory`
`Rings and fields`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites
